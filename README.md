## ✨ The 4-Step Magic
 
## 1. How It Works (The 4-Step Magic)

### Step 1: Connect Your WhatsApp (BYO-WABA)

- No complex setup. Click "Login with Facebook" inside our dashboard.
- Scan the QR code to link your existing business number.

**Benefit:** Customers see your brand name and logo, not ours. You own the customer data.

---

### Step 2: Upload Your Excel "Brain"

- Drag and drop your raw lead sheet.
- Map Columns: Tell the AI which column is Name, Phone, and Last Interaction Note.

---

### Step 3: Set the "Goal" & "Persona"

- **Goal:** "Ask them to renew their gym membership."
- **Persona:** "You are 'Priya', a helpful manager. Be polite but persistent."
- **Language Mode:** Select "Polyglot India" (Auto-detects language and replies in English script).

---

### Step 4: Watch the Excel Update Itself

- The AI starts chatting.
- As customers reply, the AI analyzes the intent.
- It writes back to your Excel file in real-time.

**Old Status:** "Pending"  
**New Status:** "Hot Lead - Wants 3BHK"

## 2. Key Features (Designed for India)

### 🇮🇳 1. The "Desi" Polyglot Engine (Tinglish, Hinglish, Kanglish)


**The User Says:** "Yenu price?" (Kannada written in English)  
**SheetAgent Understands:** The user is asking for the price in Kannada.  
**SheetAgent Replies:** "Sir, starting price 50 Lakhs ide. Nivu visit madtira?"

**Supported Mixes:** Telugu (Tinglish), Hindi (Hinglish), Kannada (Kanglish), Tamil (Tanglish).

---

### 🧠 2. Full Context Memory (Infinite History)

The bot doesn't just look at the current message; it reads the entire chat history.

**User:** "I am busy now."  
**Bot (2 days later):** "Hi Rahul, you mentioned you were busy on Tuesday. Is now a good time to discuss the plot details?"

**Impact:** It builds rapport, making the customer feel valued, not spammed.

---

### 🎯 3. NLP & Voice Classification

In India, many users prefer sending Voice Notes instead of typing.

- Voice-to-Text: The AI listens to the audio (in Hindi/Telugu etc.), transcribes it, and understands the intent.
- Smart Classification: It updates a specific "Lead Quality" column in your Excel based on the tone.

**Customer:** "Price is too high, I will let you know." → Status: Cold / Price Sensitive  
**Customer:** "Location send karo." → Status: Hot / Action Required

---

### 🔄 4. The "Excel-Loop" Technology

- **Read:** AI reads Row 4: Suresh | Interested in: Villa.
- **Chat:** AI chats with Suresh on WhatsApp.
- **Write:** AI detects Suresh wants a loan. It updates Row 4, Column F (Notes): "Needs Home Loan assistance."

---
